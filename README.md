## butterfly: trans healthcare is healthcare

A Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) medication tracking assistant to provide ease-of-mind, tools for self-advocacy, and celebrations of milestones throughout the entire process.

## ü¶ã Why butterfly?
Trans healthcare is one of the most systemically disregarded and overlooked areas of healthcare. Coupled with the lack of technology aimed to support trans individuals, this leads to a huge discrepancy in trans experiences with healthcare, and HRT specifically. 
Butterfly aims to be an easy-to-use, discreet application that prioritises not only trans advocacy in healthcare, but equally prioritises celebrating trans joy.

Built on react-native with expo, and figma.

## ü•äChallenges
This was my first time (trying to) build an app so I couldn't get too much into an actual demo. I've never used react-native before, let alone code in javascript so I definitely spent the majority of the hackathon figuring out a lot of basic things.
I also ended up spending (waaaay) too much time on the bottom taskbar and figuring out expo router navigation, but it was fulfilling to have the taskbar design closer to how I wanted it to be!

## üèÜAccomplishments
I'm glad I got part of it working, and I've discovered loads of resources that I'll be looking into. I've always been daunted by React and app development in general, so I'm glad I managed to get something started. I also was not planning on making a submission, but I ended up choosing a project that matters a lot to me so I wanted to present it, and I think that's a win!
